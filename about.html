                <p>Ok, So you've seen the intro. What else? Right? I'm 22. But I'm not like your average 22 year old.
                 My interest began with space, rockets and nasa like most kids but I soon got to know this practical
                 type of side to my personality. I started moving towards my career with the CS degree I did from UET, Lahore.
                 During that time I found out I had a knack for management , situation handling all that sort of stuff. Which I further 
                 pursued during my 6 months industry experience and that resulted in the decision of persuing a  managerial role along with 
                 applying my technical skills wherever I go.
